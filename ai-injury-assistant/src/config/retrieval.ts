// Used by injury-router.ts to decide which injuries a question without an
// explicit injuryId is actually about. Each injury has exactly one
// sourceType:'injury' summary chunk (document-builder.ts); comparing the
// question's embedding against just those chunks separates injuries far
// more reliably than pooling every record across every injury (see #209).
//
// Empirically (against the seeded dev dataset's 3 distinct injuries), the
// correct injury's summary chunk was always the closest match, with the
// smallest observed gap to the next-closest injury being ~0.07 cosine
// distance. The margin below is set comfortably under that so a clear
// single-injury match doesn't accidentally pull in a second injury, while
// still being loose enough to catch genuinely ambiguous/multi-injury
// questions (near-tied distances).

// A broad, non-injury-specific question (e.g. "How am I doing overall?")
// doesn't resemble any single injury's name/bodyArea/description, so its
// distance to every injury's summary chunk tends to be uniformly mediocre
// rather than dominated by one clear winner or a small near-tied group —
// the ambiguity margin above won't reliably catch this case (see #209/#210
// discussion). If even the *closest* injury summary doesn't beat this
// floor, treat the question as not being about any one injury in
// particular and fall back to searching across all of the user's injuries,
// rather than silently narrowing to an arbitrary subset.
//
// Measured directly against the seeded dev dataset's real user (userId 1,
// two injuries: lower back / knee) via the live embedding service — not a
// guess. Single-injury questions ("What treatments have I tried for my
// knee?", "Why does my knee hurt?", etc.) scored a best injury-summary
// distance of 0.32-0.56. Broad, non-injury-specific questions ("How am I
// doing overall?", "Summarize my recovery progress", "List all my
// treatments") scored 0.67-0.82. This default (0.62) sits in the gap
// between those two clusters. Only 2 injuries and a handful of questions
// were sampled, so this is a real-but-thin calibration, not an
// evaluation-validated cutoff — recalibrate if the evaluation dataset gains
// broad/multi-injury cases and this stops separating them correctly.

// Ceiling on how much journal text may be assembled directly into a prompt
// before the agent falls back to vector retrieval.
//
// The whole-record path exists because a single injury is small: measured
// against the seeded dataset, the largest is ~1.8k tokens. Selecting a subset
// of records within one injury therefore buys nothing and costs recall -- see
// the distance-threshold problem in #122.
//
// The binding constraint is NOT the model's context window. gpt-oss-20b
// advertises 131k, but the deployed Groq account is rate limited to 8000
// tokens per minute (`x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`), and a request larger than
// that bucket is rejected outright with HTTP 413 rather than queued. An entire
// 10-injury journal measures ~10.3k tokens and fails that way; one injury
// plus its summary figures is ~2k and succeeds.
//
// So this default is set from the account's limit, not the model's: it leaves
// room within the same per-minute bucket for the system prompt, the question,
// and the completion (which for a reasoning model includes tokens the answer
// never shows). Journals above it fall back to retrieval, which is the case
// vector search is genuinely for. Raise it via the environment if the account
// tier changes -- re-check `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` before doing so.
